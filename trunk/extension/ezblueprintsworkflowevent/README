ABOUT THIS EXTENSION
--------------------

This extension shows how to create and setup a minimal workflow event type.

Workflows are ordered groups of tasks, called events, executed automatically by
eZ Publish when the editor takes some action such eg. as publishing content.

The actions to which workflows can be hooked are called triggers.

Every event that is part of a workflow is defined in terms of a workflow type.
Event types provided by the system are "wait until a given date" and "wait for
approval". Custom event types allow the developer to add his own functionality.


INSTALL
-------

1. Unzip the extension in the "extension" folder of eZ Publish, then activate it via the Administration Interface.

2. Crate a new workflow: 'Workflows'->'Standard'->'New workflow'->'ezblueprintsworkflow'
   Add a new event of type eZBluePrintsWorkflowEvent to the workflow, then save it
   Setup the new workflow on the post-publication trigger: 'Triggers'-> 'content-publish-after' ( choose eZBluePrintsWorkflowEvent ). Apply changes.

3. Go to "Content", edit and publish some content object, you will see the "Hello Event" in your debug log.


TUTORIAL
--------

To create a workflow event type called <XXX>, the following files are needed:

    <extensionname>
        settings
		    workflow.ini.append.php
        eventtypes
            event
                <XXX>
                    <XXX>type.php

The event type has to be registered in workflow.ini.append.php:

<?php /*
 
[EventSettings]
ExtensionDirectories[]=<extensionname>
AvailableEventTypes[]=event_<XXX>

*/ ?>

A php class named <XXX>Type has to be declared in eventtypes/event/<XXX><XXX>type.php.
It has to be a subclass of eZWorkflowEventType.
